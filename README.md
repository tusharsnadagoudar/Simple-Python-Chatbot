# Simple Python Chatbot
A rule-based chatbot I built to understand how to use Data Structures and logic flow in Python.

## What it does
This bot acts as a conversational agent that matches user inputs to predefined responses. I implemented a **keyword matching algorithm** that scans the user's sentence to find specific triggers (like "hello" or "motivate me") and responds accordingly.

## Features
- **Pattern Matching:** Iterates through a dictionary of keys to find keywords within the user's natural language input.
- **Data Structures:** Uses Python Dictionaries to store Knowledge Base (Input-Output pairs).
- **Continuous Interaction:** Runs inside a `while` loop to maintain a conversation until the exit command is given.

## Tech Stack
- **Concepts:** Dictionaries, Loops ('while', 'for'), String Manipulation ('.lower()').
